# ContaX

This is a simple app that allow you to manage your contacts.

## Features

1. Built on the Flutter framework (not a feature I know)
2. Has Email-Password and Google Authentication.
3. Allows you to register a new account in the app itself.
4. Stores all the contact information in Firestore Database. This means that all your contacts are synced across your android devices.
5. Redirects you to call and email directly from the app.

## Features to be added:

1. Adding profile picture costomisation.
2. Adding SMS redirection.
3. UI Improvements (I am not a UI designer I tried my best).
4. Ability to render more than 60fps (I use a 120hz screen and I hate 60fps apps).
